# Washington-house-sales-Dashboard
It is a tableau visualization dashboard on the dataset of Washington house sales.

## Key features:
- Average House Sales Price on Daily: A line chart that tracks price trends.
- Map Visualization: To understand the geographic distribution of house prices.
- Bedrooms & Bathrooms Distribution: To Understand the frequency of various house configurations.
- House Price Distribution: It's a Detailed breakdown of house prices based on the frequency.

  This dashboard provides valuable insights into the housing market and helps identify key trends and patterns. Especially the calendar feature that helps to visualize data based on a particular date or an entire month. I have also tried to filter the data by adding a feature of year and sqft selection which helps to understand the data using various ranges.

### This is the final Dashboard:
